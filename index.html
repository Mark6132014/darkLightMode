        Hello! Isn't this confusing??
    </h1>
    <p>
        This is another illusion. This is actually in dark mode. Didn't you know that? But the background is white.

    <h2>
        How to do it?
    </h2>
    <p>
        HTML Code:
    </p>
    <code>
        &lt;meta name="color-scheme" content="dark"&gt;
    </code>
    <p>
        CSS Code:
    </p>
    <code>
        html, body * {
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;background: white;
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color: black;
            <br>
        }

    <h2>
        How to understand this is really in dark mode?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Well you see, when you look closely at the scrollbar, you will see the scrollbar dark.
        <br>
        Which means that the dark mode meta tag is added to the webpage, or using scrollbar-color in CSS.
        <br>
        You can only notice it on Desktops. Not mobile devices!
